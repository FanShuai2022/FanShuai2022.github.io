## Why Teach Computer Science? 
Computer science is more than just math and coding. Teaching students computer science from an early age, 
helps them build logical and analytical skills that they can apply in academics and beyond. 
Studies show that students who learn coding from an early age perform better in critical thinking and the better the test scores are in reading, writing, math, and science. 
Not only does it build confidence, but it allows students to embrace the beauty of their mistakes and quickly adjust to the challenges and build strong solutions around them. These skills will translate into opportunities for the future and have a lasting impact on the world. 
## Why Learn Coding at a Young Age? 
Learning to code is like learning a new superpower! It helps kids think logically, solve problems, and be creative. 
Plus, in the future, many exciting jobs will need coders.
